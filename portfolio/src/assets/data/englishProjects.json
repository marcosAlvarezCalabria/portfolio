It also includes a feature to find nearby cinemas using Google Maps. I developed the application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and an integrated API for efficient communication. I used Docker to deploy the application consistently and portably across different environments."

The application enables users to search and offer skills, establish connections, and plan meetings. It is built using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Handlebars for view rendering."
